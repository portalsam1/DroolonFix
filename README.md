# DroolonFix

Horribly ineffcient and slightly destructive "fix" for the Droolon F1 in Neos.
Use at your own risk and only if youre as frustrated as I was.

This doesn't work on all avatars for some god forsaken reason and I have no clue why but oh well.

It is slightly destructive as in it will null the rotation drive on the EyeRotationDriver and won't restore it.
Anything else about it is non-persistant.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader/releases).
1. Place [DroolonFix.dll](https://github.com/portalsam1/DroolonFix/releases/download/DroolonFix-1.0/DroolonFix.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
